        <h3 class="text-uppercase ">why do we choose this application?what are problems that we are facing with current
            system?</h3>
        <p class="text-capitalize ">---->we choose to make this application, because we ensure to have a fair and smooth
            way of taking attendance instead wasting plenty of valuble time and also for catching the regular defaulters
            who are not attending the classes, so that the remaining time a teacher can use for his teaching purpose
        </p>
        <pre>
            Problem with the current system 
            1) Taking attendance manually in an offline mode is a cumbersome
            process
            2) Effectiveness is always a question
            3) Effective teaching time reduces significantly
            4) Teachers are unequipped to understand their class comprehensively
            5) Lack of transparency in the student's side.
             </pre>

        <p class="text-capitalize"> ----> The new system would allow students to access his/her attendance
            records and will provide a heck lots of tools for the teachers to simplify the
            entire process.</p>
        <h3 class="text-uppercase">what is the scope of this application?</h3>
        <P class="text-capitalize">
        <ol>
            <li class="text-capitalize ">The scope of this application is a web application that is capable to take
                attendance and storing all the relevant data in the database.</li>
            <li class="text-capitalize"> The current manually attendance taking process will be replaced by our
                web application which will simplify the entire process once and for all.</li>
        </ol>
        </P>
        <h3 class="text-uppercase">Those who will primarily benefit from the new system and those who will
            be affected by the new system include?</h3>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li class="text-capitalize">Teachers:
                Upon implementation of the new system, teachers can just focus on
                teaching and will find it easier to create class section wise, view
                attendance stats, know class defaulters.</li>


            <li class="text-capitalize">All students will be allowed to view their attendance records hence
                bringing in transparency also the new system will act as proxy firewall for
                the regular defaulters hence will help in disincentivizing bad actions.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>


        <h3 class="text-uppercase">will this application is available for every potential member?</h3>
        <p class="text-capitalize text-dark">The system will be available to any potential class member (either student
            or teachers) using the Internet. Project developers may also use the
            system from any location and will be able to access restricted areas of the
            site through a password protection scheme</p>
        <h3 class="text-uppercase">primary responsibilities of this newsytem?</h3>
        <p>
        <pre>
            The primary responsibilities of the new system:
        --> Make the attendance taking process completely automated by using
            uniquely generated QR code assigned to each and every student.
        --> Provide teachers with a handful of tools so that the teachers can just
            focus on delivering quality content to their students.
        --> Allow students to access their previous track records when it comes
            to attendance.
        --> Help teachers to know who are the class bunkers and class defaulters
       </pre>
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-uppercase">is this application really needed?why?</h3>
        <p class="text-capitalize">This application is needed in order to save the 10-12 mins in a class of 1 hr,
            which can be used in doubt clarification, taking surprise quizzes etc. The
            new system will achieve this by making the entire process extremely
            automated hence quick.</p>

        <h3>Marking Attendance (by student)</h3></br>

        <pre>Summary:</pre>

        <p class="text-capitalize">This use case takes attendance of student</p>
        <pre>Basic flow:</pre>

        <ol>

            <li class="text-capitalize">The teacher will “start attendance” in the web app in his/her
                system and allow camera access.</li>
            <li class="text-capitalize">Every student has to scan his/her unique QR code in the teachers
                camera to mark his/her attendance</li>

        </ol>
        <pre>Alternate flows:</pre>

        <ul>
            <li class="text-capitalize">If the system could not recognise the QR code, then the teacher
                must refresh the attendance section and scan the QR again.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre>Pre condition:</pre>
        <ul>
            <li>The user scanning the QR code must be a student.</li>
        </ul>

        <pre>Post condition:</pre>
        <ul>
            <li>The student's attendance will be marked and the attendance will
                be added to the student's dashboard</li>

        </ul>

        <pre>Business rules:</pre>

        <ul>
            <li>The teacher must ensure that a student scans only one QR code ,
                to check students from making false attendance of other students.</li>
        </ul>
